# TMDB-Movie-Data-Analysis
In this project, I will be investigating TMDB Movie dataset using pyhton libraries (pandas, numpy and matplotlib). TMBD Movie dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The process is divided into data wrangling, eploratory data analysis, and conclusion.
 The analysis is focused on answering the following questions:
1. How did amount of movies produced change over the years?
2. What are the most profitable movies?
3. What are the top movies based on popularity?
4. What is the relationship between profit and popularity?
5. What are the top genres produced?
6. What is the relationship between revenue and budget?
